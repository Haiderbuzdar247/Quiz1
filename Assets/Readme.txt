Game Name:
Ball Blast
Reason :
As it was one of those games i've played the most so, the mechanism convinced me to build that game.
Hurdles :
Moving ball Score along with the ball, Decreasing score and destroying object at score=0.
Uncompleted Task :
Spliting the ball into two small balls was incomplete. As destroying and initiated two different balls at the same point was the hurdle for me.
